## 2.1.1 (A) [[Enqueue Styles & Scripts]]

### **Overview**
Enqueuing is the correct method for loading CSS and JavaScript files in WordPress themes and plugins. Instead of directly inserting `<link>` or `<script>` tags in templates, WordPress uses the functions `wp_enqueue_style()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` to manage assets. This ensures proper dependency handling, version control, conditional loading, and compatibility with plugins, caching systems, and CDNs.
### **Key Functions**

| Function                                       | **Brief (>20 words)**                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[wp_enqueue_style()]]                         | Loads CSS files in a controlled WordPress-managed system, preventing duplication, allowing versioning, dependency relationships, and supporting theme or plugin compatibility without conflicts. |
| `wp_enqueue_script()`                          | Loads JavaScript files efficiently with dependency support, footer placement, and version control, ensuring faster performance, improved management, and reduced risk of script conflicts.       |
| `wp_register_style()` / `wp_register_script()` | Registers CSS or JS for conditional or delayed loading, enabling advanced performance optimization by enqueueing assets only when required based on context.                                     |
| `wp_enqueue_scripts`                           | The primary action hook used to enqueue front-end assets, ensuring all scripts and styles are added at the correct time during page generation.                                                  |
| `admin_enqueue_scripts`                        | Loads assets inside the WordPress admin interface, allowing custom UI enhancements for settings pages, dashboards, or plugin configuration tools.                                                |
| `wp_head()` / `wp_footer()`                    | Template locations where WordPress outputs enqueued assets, giving developers control over where scripts are executed for performance or functionality needs.                                    |

## 2.1.1 (B) Add Shortcodes

### **Overview**
Shortcodes provide a powerful way to insert dynamic and reusable content into WordPress posts, pages, and widgets without requiring users to write PHP or modify templates. They act like simplified placeholders that trigger functional PHP callbacks, enabling features such as forms, buttons, sliders, or data listings. Shortcodes improve content flexibility and empower non-technical users to add advanced functionality inside the editor environment.

### **Key Functions**

|Function|**Brief (>20 words)**|
|---|---|
|`add_shortcode()`|Registers a shortcode name and links it to a callback function that returns dynamic output, enabling reusable components within posts and pages without modifying templates.|
|Shortcode Callback Function|Contains the logic executed when the shortcode runs, capable of processing attributes, performing queries, generating HTML, and returning formatted output for display.|
|Shortcode Attributes (`$atts`)|Allows users to customize shortcode behavior via parameters like size, category, color, or limit values, enabling flexible reusable component configuration.|
|Shortcode Usage (`[example]`)|The editor-facing format that users type or insert, giving a simple non-technical method for embedding dynamic functionality directly within WordPress content.|
|Nested Shortcodes|Enables multiple shortcodes to be placed inside each other, helpful for complex layout components such as tabs, accordions, galleries, or multi-block structured UI patterns.|

## 2.1.1 (C) Custom Post Type

### **Overview**
Custom Post Types (CPTs) allow WordPress developers to define structured content beyond default Posts and Pages. They are essential when building advanced websites such as product catalogs, event systems, course libraries, portfolios, directories, or documentation platforms. CPTs help provide scalable organization, custom editor interfaces, and dedicated front-end display, making WordPress function as a complete CMS rather than just a blogging tool.
### **Key Functions**

|Function|**Brief (>20 words)**|
|---|---|
|`register_post_type()`|Registers a new structured content type with custom labels, settings, and behavior, enabling storage, management, and presentation of specialized data within WordPress.|
|`$args` Configuration|Controls visibility, supported editor features, menu placement, permalink structure, and archive settings, giving developers full control over user experience and data handling.|
|`supports`|Defines which editing tools are enabled—such as title, editor, featured image, custom fields, revisions—allowing tailored content-creation environments for specific use cases.|
|`menu_position` / `menu_icon`|Determines where the CPT appears in the admin sidebar and what icon represents it, improving workflow clarity and providing polished UI architecture.|
|`has_archive`|Automatically generates an archive listing page for the CPT, enabling collection views such as product lists, event calendars, portfolios, or searchable item directories.|
|`rewrite`|Customizes URL slug and permalink structure to improve SEO, readability, and navigation consistency across the site and external search tools.|

## 2.1.1 (D) Custom Taxonomy

### **Overview**
Custom Taxonomies allow developers to create structured classification systems that organize content beyond default WordPress categories and tags. They enable grouping, filtering, and searching of data based on defined rules, making them essential for complex websites such as product catalogs, directories, knowledge bases, libraries, and e-commerce systems. Custom taxonomies improve navigation, enhance query precision, and support better information architecture.
### **Key Functions**

|Function|**Brief (>20 words)**|
|---|---|
|`register_taxonomy()`|Registers a custom taxonomy and associates it with one or more post types, enabling structured grouping and improved organization across large sets of related content.|
|`$args` Configuration|Controls visibility, hierarchical structure, admin UI behavior, rewrite slugs, and query options, allowing taxonomies to function as categories or tags depending on requirements.|
|Hierarchical (`true / false`)|Defines whether the taxonomy behaves like categories with parent–child structure or like flat tags, helping developers choose the appropriate organization style.|
|`rewrite`|Customizes URL and slug formats to improve navigation clarity and SEO friendliness when browsing or filtering through content grouped by the taxonomy.|
|`show_admin_column`|Adds taxonomy columns into CPT lists within the admin panel, making filtering and management of related items simpler for editors and administrators.|
|`labels`|Defines custom interface text for taxonomy fields, improving usability, clarity, and editorial workflow inside the WordPress admin interface.|

## 2.1.1 (E) Basic Theme Template

### **Overview**
Basic theme templates define how WordPress renders content on the front end using its template hierarchy system. Each template file controls a different type of page such as single posts, pages, archives, search results, or home views. Understanding template structure is essential for customizing layout, styling, and dynamic display logic in themes. Mastery of these templates forms the foundation for building custom themes and modifying the presentation of any WordPress website.
### **Key Components**

|Component|**Brief (>20 words)**|
|---|---|
|`single.php`|Controls how individual posts are displayed, allowing customization of layout, metadata placement, sidebars, and post-specific visual elements inside a single viewing page.|
|`page.php`|Renders static WordPress pages, enabling unique designs for landing pages, contact pages, or custom layouts separate from standard blog post formatting.|
|`archive.php`|Displays collections or lists of posts, including categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and CPT archives, providing users with navigable grouped content views.|
|`index.php`|The fallback template used when no other specific template matches, ensuring compatibility and base rendering for all types of WordPress content.|
|`header.php` / `footer.php`|Defines globally shared layout sections such as navigation menus, branding, scripts, and footers, ensuring consistent UI structure across all templates.|
|`home.php` / `front-page.php`|Determines how the site homepage is rendered, supporting custom static homepages or dynamic post listings based on configuration preferences.|
